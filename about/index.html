		<p>I'm Matt Faluotico. Which I'm sure you already assumed. I study Computer Science & Engineering (which we call CSE) at The Ohio State University. Most of my work is visual in some sort of way â€“ I like seeing the results. I throw most of my work on GitHub. At OSU, I work as a teachers assistant for a web applications course and work IT for the Knowlton School of Architecture. I'm also the president of the Mobile App Club and a co-founder of Buckeye Hackers.</p>

		<p>I spend a lot of time listening, making, and sharing to music. Really, a lot of time. Follow me on Spotify, and I'll send you some tunes.</p>

		<p>Right now, I'm interning at JPMorgan Chase in the beautiful city of San Francisco, developing user interfaces for Chase.com. Upon returning home, I'll be graduating from OSU, at which time I'll be looking for work. If you have an awesome gig, I would love to hear about it.</p>

		<p>My favorite font is <span class="gotham">Gotham</span> (original, I know). I tend to overuse white. I play the acoustic guitar (usually a Martin). Xcode/Sublime Text. I really like a good pair of pants. Love a good Gin & Tonic. Favorite musician is Chet Faker.</p>
