	<p>I'm Matt Faluotico. Which I'm sure you assumed by now. I study Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. Most of my work is visual in some sort of way â€“ I like seeing the results. I throw most of my work on GitHub.</p>

	<p>I spend a lot of time listening to, making, and sharing music. Really, a lot of time. Follow me on Spotify, and I'll send you some something.</p>
